== DNS Packet Dissector

1.5 days of hard-coding and now it is working. And working nice.

Included files:
* dns.so - compiled library for Wireshark (for Linux x64). Place it into your plugins folder inside Wireshark
* src/ - directory with source files. Visit http://wireshark.org to know how to compile it.
